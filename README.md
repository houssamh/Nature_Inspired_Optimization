# Nature_Inspired_Optimization

- This project is under construction.

* Several Nature-inspired optimization algorithms are considered here.

## Use

In "gradientDescent.cpp" write your objective function, and in "main.cpp" run the minimization process.

## Adding a new algorithm

You can add your algorithm in the project, for example, "example.hpp" in "include" folder and "example.cpp" in "src" folder.

In addition, add "#include "example.hpp" in "metaheuristic.hpp".

## Compile the project

- Open a terminal in the project folder

- In the terminal, type the following commands:

  - cmake ..

  - make

  - ./Optimizer (to run)
